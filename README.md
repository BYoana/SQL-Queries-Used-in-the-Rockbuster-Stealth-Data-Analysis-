# SQL-Queries-Used-in-the-Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis-
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The main purpose for conducting this analysis is to help with the launching of the strategy for the new online video service by looking into and analysing data starting from inventory all the way to customer related behaviour. The data analysis will be conducted with the support of SQL queries that will be operated in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

The questions that will be answered by the analysis:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

**Data Set**: data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. It will be first loaded into the PostgreSQL database:
- It’s around 3MB and contains several files.
- A relationship exists between two tables if a column name is present in both tables.
